# UI components library with Next.js & Storybook

This is a UI components library for the convenient use of components in the Monorepo packages.
Benefits of building components and showcasing them in Storybook:

- Build components in isolation
- Test hard to reach use cases
- Document UI components

> Storybook is especially helpful if you are working on a large project or in a team. Once a project
> gets too big, it is impossible to remember all of the components you built. If you are working in
> a team, all developers can find components used in your app to prevent repeating code.

## How to run

Run Storybook (to check Storybook environment of components):

```bash
# make sure that the root dependencies are all installed
yarn dev
```

### UI Components Library Structure

This project is running with NextJS so it follows the framework directives (`/pages` `/public`
folders). UI Components in `/src/components` folder. For Storybook look `.storybook` and `stories`.

Here is the complete structure:

```sh

├──.storybook                  # Storybook config
├── build/                     # Build Folders for config files
├── public/                    # Public assets
│ ├── img/                     # img assets
├── src/                       # Source files
│ ├── components/              # React Atomic Compoments
├── stories/                   # Storybook stories (component imported here for Storybook use)
├── styles/                    # Global styling and pkgs styling imports
├── .babelrc
├──.gitignore                  # Local Git ignore files/folders
├── package.json
└── readme.md

```

### Storybook components title path

```
